game-bucket
===========

Common game utilities + rollup config, suitable for a small game competition. Like [JS13k](http://js13kgames.com/)!

Includes:

- [Component Entity System](src/ces.js)
- [Stable Game Loop with interpolation and panic modes](src/loop.js)
- [Scheduling, for game-time dependent time events](src/time.js)
- JS13K-compatible zip creation + notice of how close you are to the limit: `npm run zip`
- Rollup, so you still get to use modules and separate files.
- More? You should make a PR!

[Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/) bundles JS using ES2015 modules, but does not leave any of the import/export syntax in the resulting bundle. It pulls everything into the same lexical scope, uniquely named. This makes it excellent for a size-based competition, because by its very nature it emits the smallest representation of code! Combined with UglifyJS this gets us very close to a nice base size.

Usage
-----

Fork this repo, then add / change code in index.js as you see fit! There are two dependencies included, but you can remove those. Rollup ensures that only code you `import` is included!

The default branch for this repo is `gh-pages`, so it's easy to share your game as well! For example, [index.html](index.html) is available at [[gh-username].github.io/game-bucket/index.html](http://kirbysayshi.github.io/game-bucket/index.html)!

### `npm run zip`

How close are you to the limit? Compiles in production mode, and creates a zip suitable for JS13K!

### `npm run build`

Build the `bundle.js`. Use `NODE_ENV=production npm run build` to remove debug / runtime checks (similar to how [React does it](https://facebook.github.io/react/downloads.html#npm)).

### `npm run watch`

Rebuild quickly for development mode!

### `npm run uglify-view`

See what the compiled JS will look like, to make sure rollup is treeshaking / hoisting as expected and that dead code is being eliminated. Requires `bundle.js` to exist.
